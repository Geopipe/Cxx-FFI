# Cxx-FFI
A utility library to support using C++ libraries through a C FFI, available under LGPL.
Please compile the examples using CMake to see how it works.
Depends on RE2 and Boost.

A legacy version, based on libclang's Python bindings is present in the `legacy/python` subdirectory.
The Python version is provided under a more permissive license (see doc comments at the top of each .py), but has substantial limitations.

Pull-requests with either enhancements or bug-fixes are welcome.
